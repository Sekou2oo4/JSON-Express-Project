    <h2>About This Library Project</h2>
    <p>
      This web application is a student-built project designed to simulate the basic functionality of a digital library. The
      core idea is to bridge the front-end interface with a back-end server using an API, making the experience interactive and dynamic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express.js</strong> on the server-side, we create a RESTful API that serves
      book data stored in JSON format. On the front-end, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to build a clean and accessible
      user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project demonstrates how real-world web development works: static content, client-server communication, and
      live data rendering. It is an introduction to building full-stack web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire project is also version-controlled via GitHub, showcasing industry practices in collaborative software development.
